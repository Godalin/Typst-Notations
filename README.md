# Typst Notations 4 Notes (or Publications in the future)

This is my personal library of shorthands for note taking,
or maybe for publications in the future if typst is accepted
by ACM, of course.

My interests are:
- Category Theory, in file `CatT.typ`
- Logic, `to be arranged`
- Type Theory, `to be arranged`

And other files:
- Proof writing, in file `Proof.typ`
- Shorthands, e.g., "lam" for "lambda", in file `Short.typ`
